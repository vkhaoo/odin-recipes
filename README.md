Here's a recap of this project:

What was I trying to learn?
The reason I decided to make this small project, is to test my new knowledge over basic HTML coding.

What have I learned?
I have enjoyed working with basic HTML logic, such as the basic intestation (boilerplate) of html, basic tags, usage of links and images in an html file.

What have I mostly struggled with?
I have struggled a fair bit when it came to images. During this project I had the chance to work with quite a few image format files, I struggled to find the one that would match best this small project, until I was able to find the one I liked the most, *.png files.
